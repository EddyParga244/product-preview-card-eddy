## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

In this project I learned how to use Grid displays in conjunction with Flexbox and also how to use Flexbox inside another Flexbox. I found this project a bit challenging because I had difficulty aligning the items perfectly while using grid and making the text content use adecuete space.

### Continued development

I will continue using Flexbox and Grid for responsive projects in the future, and I'll add more media queries to support more screen width of different devices.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me clear some doubts regarding Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
